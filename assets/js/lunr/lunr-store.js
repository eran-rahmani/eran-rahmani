On each vase, I painted three fishes using underglaze painting, in a way to appear swimming when rotating the vase.This idea was inspired by the goblet discovered in the “Shahr-e Sukhteh” archaeological site in Iran. This archaeological artifact is considered the earliest discovered animation, depicting a goat in a continuous motion of running.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Stoneware, 10×10×3 cm, 2019       I crafted this piece using stoneware clay material made in our workshop. Then, I used the slab technique to shape the object and underglaze painting to add a minimalistic fish illustration.

The story follows a child living in a bleak and harsh society, surviving through petty theft. However, the contents of a single stolen bag lead the child onto a new path. As an exercise, I attempted to illustrate a frame from this story, where hope and life are reborn. The frame consists of six moments that unfold as the reader flips through the pages.

Among these techniques, collage holds a special place. To design the characters of this collection, I used translucent parchment papers. I began by coloring the papers and cutting them into random shapes. In fact, my approach to achieving deformation was to stack these random shapes, layer by layer, one on top of the other.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Despite my spontaneous exploration of forms, I had to overcome the challenge of color composition: Due to the transparency of the parchment paper, each underlying layer introduced its own tonality, shadow, and silhouettes to the layers on top. Overcoming this challenge turned out to add another perspective to this collection’s pieces.

The aim of making this collection was “not to think”, and also to absolutely improvise and to be creative in the moment. I did the collaged portraits with free hand movement and without looking at the paper. Being free and not exposed to inner judgments and predispositions helped me illustrate my subconscious and reveal layers of which I was unaware. For example, during my childhood, my mother worked as a tailor. Now, I find stitching with threads and needles on paper very soothing. Using nets is another example. I subconsciously made fishing nets that seem to be capturing the portraits, across the Void.

As I have always been interested in this technique, I was fortunate to have a chance at the university to formally learn and experiment with multiple methods, including mono-printing, silk-screening, linoleum printing, and batik printing. What captivates me about printing is that although the experience is pre-planned, the results are always novel and pleasantly unpredictable. One of my hobbies is designing small characters and printing them using linoleum. I also use mono-print as a regular practice. Nevertheless, silk-screening remains my favorite due to its versatility in printing on various surface types and the stencil preparation process.

Batik Print, 95×95 cm, 2019       Stamped Batik is another printmaking technique that I learned during my studies. When I learn a new technique, I actively attempt to find ways to link it with my existing skills. To print on these scarves, I used a verse by Reza Baraheni, that translates to: “Without you, what shall I do?”. I incorporated what I learned in the Calligraphy class to design this sentence as the central motif, and what I learned in the carpentry workshop to carve the wooden stamp.

This work is a reminder to myself and my friend of hope, brightness, transformation, and changes, even in the days when seeing the bright side of life seems impossible. This work is one of my early attempts at exploring social concepts. I created a clay plate with matte black glaze, then arranged the human figurines in these positions to serve the concept I wanted to convey.

Human, while alive, create pottery; after death, their body is decomposed into dust; the dust, in turn, will be shaped into clay and pottery by future humans. To reflect this notion in this week’s medium, I made unglazed Biscuit pottery in its most primitive form to assemble with the human figurines.                                                                                                                                       Another reflection that contributed to this work was that beyond the life and death cycle, we happen to share the time of being alive with a set of other human beings. The result of this accidental overlapping existence (in terms of time and location) is the texture of society. No matter how different we are or how we live in our personal space, we form bonds with other humans. These bonds culminate together to form a society: a delicate collective representation of unique humans.

We use linguistic conventions to reduce this broad spectrum of sensory perceptions into words. Nevertheless, not only what people see with their physical eyes is unique, this notion can also be extended to more abstract forms of seeing, such as ideas, viewpoints, and interpretations. One might say that we have a third eye, our actual eyes, that sees the world beyond the limitation of sensory perceptions and language.

        "excerpt":"     Interactive map, tap the pins to see photos   Being born and having grown up on the shores of the Persian Gulf profoundly shaped my identity. Here, fish are not just a meal on the table. I have heard them in traditional melodies, read them in fairy tales, slept while hearing them in my parents’ lullabies, and known people with jobs or hobbies entangled with fish. While playing and abstracting with fish forms were always part of my daily sketches and creative practices, at first, I rarely used them as a focal subject of my works. Around a year and half ago, after filling many notebooks with fish forms in a short period, I realized the need to bring them out of my personal space and share them in public spaces and urban environments; locations where many people would see them, or at least, pass by them.   Along with the display location, I decided to add an interactive element to this project. I printed the forms on sticky-back papers and asked my friends to help me with this project. I invited them to choose a spot suitable for the fish, stick it, and then send me a photo, capturing the blending of their fish with the surrounding environment. Up until now, 59 fish have been placed across 36 cities in 14 countries.   The volunteers were urged to put the stickers only on legally and socially acceptable spots or remove the stickers immediately after taking the photograph, to avoid causing any disturbance.

I designed this logo for a software package named “rbioapi””). The logo’s elements highlight the package’s two key domains: R programming language and Biology. From the term “bio,” the letter B resembles the iconic DNA structure, representing the biology aspect; and the second and third letters (io) are designed to resemble the binary code’s one and zero, representing computers and programming. The hexagonal emblem follows the R language programmers’ tradition for their packages’ logos.  ","categories": [],

The dense branches of Prosopis and its ominous shadows on the full moon nights have sparked numerous tales in people’s minds. In these stories, women, children, and faithful men are immune to harm… But an unfaithful man, wandering near one of these trees under the moonlight, becomes prey to “omoldas.” omoldas takes on the form of a woman astonishingly beautiful, with gilded embellishments, an exotic scent, and a charming dress. The unfaithful man falls to her seduction; so blinded that he does not see that the feet of omoldas were made of sickles, sickles that bring death to the cheating man.                                                                                                                                                         The narrative portrays omoldas as the most sinister and scary creature in the South’s mythology. But is she that dangerous? What if we view the story’s origin from the perspective of traditional women, whose lives were only confined to household chores? In this sense, omoldas is a character that embodies feminine sentiments towards unfaithfulness and offers some sort of remedy in a world that is unjust and cruel to women.   In this work, the ceramic figure’s fate is determined by the metallic sickle on the cutting board. The oscillating sickle can kill the unfaithful figure while also acting as a protective umbrella for the other one. The audience can move the sickle to unfold one of these two outcomes. Hence, making a judgment about omoldas’s motives.

You may call it an etude that is tangible rather than being drawn on paper. The building blocks are ceramics, welded copper, and seashells. While being independent, a shared color, material, or shape connects the pieces. The pieces can be attached using a thread, providing the possibility to create new necklaces by selecting different parts and arrangements.   This process simulates a puzzle, combining design and exploration elements. In essence, this design allows you to simultaneously be both the consumer and the artist; you are wearing your own narrative.

This is also extended to their daily life within the household. Traditionally their roles were simply to raise children and do household chores. Paradoxically, using large-sized golden embellishments was common among them. The paradox arises as if they traded their fundamental rights with some precious metals.   The semicircular or crescent shape of those traditional golden necklaces inspires the necklaces in this collection. I used a combination of ceramics, casting and welding brass, and welded coins. My deliberate choice of these non-precious materials aims to call out the actual value of gold for those women in a society that deprived them of their inherent human values. “Mama Gapoo”, meaning grandmother in my local dialect, is the name that I called my grandmother by. I named this collection after her, as a tribute to all the hardness she endured throughout her life.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         “Mama Gapoo”, meaning grandmother in my local dialect, is the name that I called my grandmother by.

Choosing Crafts and working in a three-dimensional it broadened my perspective and provided me with the  ability to choose the proper medium and material for each of my concepts.   After graduation, I explored Illustrations and Printmaking in more depth. I aspire to evolve into a visual artist who combines diverse materials and techniques to develop her thoughts and art creations.
