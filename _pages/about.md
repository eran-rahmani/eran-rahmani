<br>  
I wanted to approach "Art" as a whole, not being limited to a single discipline. So, I pursued a B.A. in Crafts with a
specialization in ceramics.

Choosing Crafts and working in a three-dimensional it broadened my perspective and provided me with the 
ability to choose the proper medium and material for each of my concepts.

After graduation, I explored Illustrations and Printmaking in more depth. I aspire to evolve into a
visual artist who combines diverse materials and techniques to develop her thoughts and art creations.
Learning and experiencing as I go and progressively building a more expressive (and personal) artistic voice
of my own.
