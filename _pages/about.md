<br>  
I wanted to approach “Art” as a whole, without being limited to a single discipline. Therefore, I pursued a B.A. in Fine Arts with a specialization in Ceramics. 

Studying Fine Arts and working in three dimensions broadened my perspective and provided me with the ability to choose the proper medium and material for each of my concepts. 

After graduation, I explored illustration and printmaking in more depth. Today, I work as a visual artist, combining diverse materials and techniques to shape and express my ideas. Through ongoing exploration and lived experience, I’ve developed a more expressive, deeply personal artistic voice that continues to evolve through my work.
