"The Promise" is a captivating book written by Nicola Davies and illustrated by Laura Carlin. The story follows a child living in a bleak and harsh society, surviving through petty theft. However, the contents of a single stolen bag lead the child onto a new path.
As an exercise, I attempted to illustrate a frame from this story, where hope and life are reborn. The frame consists of six moments that unfold as the reader flips through the pages.
