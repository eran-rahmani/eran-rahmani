No matter how normal it may appear, living in a temporary condition for a prolonged period is boresome. A life that is nothing more than being wrapped inside bubble rolls, fuzzy and undecided is a life that does not even feel like weightlessly floating, instead resembles a shark adrift without fins.

Metamorphosis is a self-portrait displayed in a group exhibition titled “Faces.” In this exhibition, artists from various disciplines from an Iranian province, Hormozgan, were invited to contribute a piece with the theme of self-portraits.
