I have created this series of collage illustrations for a personal [portfolio website of a scientific researcher](https://moosa-r.com "Moosa Rezwani")"). Through these illustrations, I tried to summarize the goals of a scientific project. Additionally, I tried to employ defamiliarization to present the specific notations in a novel and engaging perspective.

Collage illustration of a man capturing digital clouds: This illustration depicts the functionality of a scientific software package called rbioapi. This package enables seamless retrieval of data from biological databases and web services. I metaphorically portrayed this functionality as a man attempting to capture digital clouds and feed them into a computer.

Collage illustration of an immune cell donating blood in a blood collection facility: The research aim was to propose the waste products from blood transfusion procedures as a source of specific immune system cells, known as NK cells. By presenting the concept in a reverse fashion and using familiar yet out-of-place elements, I tried to have a humorous take on this project

Collage illustration of an immune cell playing chess with a humoral cell: In the field of cancer research, one of the biggest challenges is that the interaction between the human immune system and tumors is Incredibly complex. This research aimed to decipher part of this complexity by studying the interplay between a tumoral and an immune system’s cell type called the NK cell. I reimagined this complexity as an intense chess match between these two cells.

Collage illustration of magical duplication of cats: This illustration builds on the wordplay made by a programming package’s developer. The package is named “parapurrr.” The package facilitates running multiple instances of another package called “purrr.” Beyond the cats resembling the word “purrr,” the illustration features a magician performing on a stage to emphasize the goal of the software package, enabling the users to perform this parallelization process easily.

I designed this logo for a software package named [“rbioapi”](https://rbioapi.moosa-r.com "rbioapi: User-Friendly R Interface to Biologic Web Services' API")"). The logo’s elements highlight the package’s two key domains: R programming language and Biology. From the term “bio,” the letter B resembles the iconic DNA structure, representing the biology aspect; and the second and third letters (io) are designed to resemble the binary code’s one and zero, representing computers and programming. The hexagonal emblem follows the R language programmers’ tradition for their packages’ logos.
