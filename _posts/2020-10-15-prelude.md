In this collection, each necklace serves as a prelude to the next necklace. You may call it an etude that is tangible rather than being drawn on paper. The building blocks are ceramics, welded copper, and seashells. While being independent, a shared color, material, or shape connects the pieces. The pieces can be attached using a thread, providing the possibility to create new necklaces by selecting different parts and arrangements. 

This process simulates a puzzle, combining design and exploration elements. In essence, this design allows you to simultaneously be both the consumer and the artist; you are wearing your own narrative.
