This is one of my earliest attempts at merging illustration and pottery. On each vase, I painted three fishes using underglaze painting, in a way to appear swimming when rotating the vase.This idea was inspired by the goblet discovered in the “Shahr-e Sukhteh” archaeological site in Iran. This archaeological artifact is considered the earliest discovered animation, depicting a goat in a continuous motion of running.

I crafted this piece using stoneware clay material made in our workshop. Then, I used the slab technique to shape the object and underglaze painting to add a minimalistic fish illustration.
