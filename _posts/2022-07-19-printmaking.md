My first experiences with printing date back to my teenage years. As I have always been interested in this technique, I was fortunate to have a chance at the university to formally learn and experiment with multiple methods, including mono-printing, silk-screening, linoleum printing, and batik printing. What captivates me about printing is that although the experience is pre-planned, the results are always novel and pleasantly unpredictable. One of my hobbies is designing small characters and printing them using linoleum. I also use mono-print as a regular practice. Nevertheless, silk-screening remains my favorite due to its versatility in printing on various surface types and the stencil preparation process.

Stamped Batik is another printmaking technique that I learned during my studies. When I learn a new technique, I actively attempt to find ways to link it with my existing skills. To print on these scarves, I used a verse by Reza Baraheni, that translates to: “Without you, what shall I do?”. I incorporated what I learned in the Calligraphy class to design this sentence as the central motif, and what I learned in the carpentry workshop to carve the wooden stamp.
