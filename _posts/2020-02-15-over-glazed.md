I have created these objects using earthenware clay and on a potter's wheel. I have utilized two glazing techniques in this collection: Matte glaze and double glaze. The double-glazed objects have a black satin glaze for the underlying layer and a sprayed gray satin glaze for the top layer. To reach unique outputs while using the same glazing technique, I have used different over-glaze layer thicknesses by spraying in different durations.
