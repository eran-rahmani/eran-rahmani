<p>In my local cultural context, even in recent decades, women have been deprived of fundamental social status and decision-making power. This is also extended to their daily life within the household. Traditionally their roles were simply to raise children and do household chores. Paradoxically, using large-sized golden embellishments was common among them. The paradox arises as if they traded their fundamental rights with some precious metals.</p>

<p>The semicircular or crescent shape of those traditional golden necklaces inspires the necklaces in this collection. I used a combination of ceramics, casting and welding brass, and welded coins. My deliberate choice of these non-precious materials aims to call out the actual value of gold for those women in a society that deprived them of their inherent human values. “Mama Gapoo”, meaning grandmother in my local dialect, is the name that I called my grandmother by. I named this collection after her, as a tribute to all the hardness she endured throughout her life.</p>

<p>In this collection, each necklace serves as a prelude to the next necklace. You may call it an etude that is tangible rather than being drawn on paper. The building blocks are ceramics, welded copper, and seashells. While being independent, a shared color, material, or shape connects the pieces. The pieces can be attached using a thread, providing the possibility to create new necklaces by selecting different parts and arrangements.</p>

<p>This process simulates a puzzle, combining design and exploration elements. In essence, this design allows you to simultaneously be both the consumer and the artist; you are wearing your own narrative.</p>

<p>In the harsh nature of southern Iran, Prosopis trees offer shelter to mythical creatures. The dense branches of Prosopis and its ominous shadows on the full moon nights have sparked numerous tales in people’s minds. In these stories, women, children, and faithful men are immune to harm… But an unfaithful man, wandering near one of these trees under the moonlight, becomes prey to “omoldas.” omoldas takes on the form of a woman astonishingly beautiful, with gilded embellishments, an exotic scent, and a charming dress. The unfaithful man falls to her seduction; so blinded that he does not see that the feet of omoldas were made of sickles, sickles that bring death to the cheating man.</p>

<p>The narrative portrays omoldas as the most sinister and scary creature in the South’s mythology. But is she that dangerous? What if we view the story’s origin from the perspective of traditional women, whose lives were only confined to household chores? In this sense, omoldas is a character that embodies feminine sentiments towards unfaithfulness and offers some sort of remedy in a world that is unjust and cruel to women.</p>

<p>In this work, the ceramic figure’s fate is determined by the metallic sickle on the cutting board. The oscillating sickle can kill the unfaithful figure while also acting as a protective umbrella for the other one. The audience can move the sickle to unfold one of these two outcomes. Hence, making a judgment about omoldas’s motives.</p>

<p>Collage illustration of an immune cell playing chess with a humoral cell: In the field of cancer research, one of the biggest challenges is that the interaction between the human immune system and tumors is Incredibly complex. This research aimed to decipher part of this complexity by studying the interplay between a tumoral and an immune system’s cell type called the NK cell. I reimagined this complexity as an intense chess match between these two cells.</p>

<p>I designed this logo for a software package named <a href="https://rbioapi.moosa-r.com" title="rbioapi: User-Friendly R Interface to Biologic Web Services' API">“rbioapi”</a>”). The logo’s elements highlight the package’s two key domains: R programming language and Biology. From the term “bio,” the letter B resembles the iconic DNA structure, representing the biology aspect; and the second and third letters (io) are designed to resemble the binary code’s one and zero, representing computers and programming. The hexagonal emblem follows the R language programmers’ tradition for their packages’ logos.</p>]]></content><author><name>Eran Rahmani</name><email>eran.rahmani.i@gmail.com</email></author><category term="Collage" /><category term="Illustration" /><category term="Logo" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Fish</title><link href="https://eran-rahmani.com/works/fish/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Fish" /><published>2020-08-15T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-08-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://eran-rahmani.com/works/fish</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://eran-rahmani.com/works/fish/"><![CDATA[<div class="iframe-container">

<p style="text-align: center;font-size:0.7em">Interactive map, tap the pins to see photos</p>

<p>Being born and having grown up on the shores of the Persian Gulf profoundly shaped my identity. Here, fish are not just a meal on the table. I have heard them in traditional melodies, read them in fairy tales, slept while hearing them in my parents’ lullabies, and known people with jobs or hobbies entangled with fish. While playing and abstracting with fish forms were always part of my daily sketches and creative practices, at first, I rarely used them as a focal subject of my works. Around a year and half ago, after filling many notebooks with fish forms in a short period, I realized the need to bring them out of my personal space and share them in public spaces and urban environments; locations where many people would see them, or at least, pass by them.</p>

<p>Along with the display location, I decided to add an interactive element to this project. I printed the forms on sticky-back papers and asked my friends to help me with this project. I invited them to choose a spot suitable for the fish, stick it, and then send me a photo, capturing the blending of their fish with the surrounding environment. Up until now, 59 fish have been placed across 36 cities in 14 countries.</p>

<p>The volunteers were urged to put the stickers only on legally and socially acceptable spots or remove the stickers immediately after taking the photograph, to avoid causing any disturbance.</p>

<p>No matter how normal it may appear, living in a temporary condition for a prolonged period is boresome. A life that is nothing more than being wrapped inside bubble rolls, fuzzy and undecided is a life that does not even feel like weightlessly floating, instead resembles a shark adrift without fins.</p>

<p>Metamorphosis is a self-portrait displayed in a group exhibition titled “Faces.” In this exhibition, artists from various disciplines from an Iranian province, Hormozgan, were invited to contribute a piece with the theme of self-portraits.</p>

<p>No two individual perceive and experience colors, forms, and shape exactly the same. We use linguistic conventions to reduce this broad spectrum of sensory perceptions into words. Nevertheless, not only what people see with their physical eyes is unique, this notion can also be extended to more abstract forms of seeing, such as ideas, viewpoints, and interpretations. One might say that we have a third eye, our actual eyes, that sees the world beyond the limitation of sensory perceptions and language.</p>

<p>This collection is a window to my real eye and how I perceive the world before it becomes homogenized within societal agreements. Using traditional fabrics collaged onto monoprints, I depicted how I see people and my surroundings. Then, by using rapidograph pens, watercolor pencils, and watercolor pastels, I brought the pieces closer to my perception of the world.</p>

<p>As a ceramist, I was always intrigued by this notion of Omar Khayyam (a Persian poet, mathematician, and astronomer): There is a cyclic relationship between humans, clay, and pottery. Human, while alive, create pottery; after death, their body is decomposed into dust; the dust, in turn, will be shaped into clay and pottery by future humans. To reflect this notion in this week’s medium, I made unglazed Biscuit pottery in its most primitive form to assemble with the human figurines.</p>

<p>Another reflection that contributed to this work was that beyond the life and death cycle, we happen to share the time of being alive with a set of other human beings. The result of this accidental overlapping existence (in terms of time and location) is the texture of society. No matter how different we are or how we live in our personal space, we form bonds with other humans. These bonds culminate together to form a society: a delicate collective representation of unique humans.</p>

<p>Anyone can experience a sense of despair at some point in their lives. This work is a reminder to myself and my friend of hope, brightness, transformation, and changes, even in the days when seeing the bright side of life seems impossible. This work is one of my early attempts at exploring social concepts. I created a clay plate with matte black glaze, then arranged the human figurines in these positions to serve the concept I wanted to convey.</p>
